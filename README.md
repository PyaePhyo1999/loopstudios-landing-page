## Acknowledgments
I was first introduced to the fundamental concepts of web development during my formal education, where I learned the basic terminology and structure of building websites. Although some time has passed since then, my interest in front-end development remained. Recently, I decided to revisit and strengthen my knowledge during my free time. In doing so, I discovered the YouTube channel GreatStack, which has been an incredibly valuable resource. It has helped me not only refresh core concepts but also practice a wide range of modern front-end design techniques through hands-on projects and tutorials.
